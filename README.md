# Bingo
Simple Python bingo 

This program ends when there is an outcome meaning either computer or player wins or tie. 
A random number is generated (upon every enter â€“ simulating a draw number) and then matched against the player and computer cards and as soon as it matches the length of the card reduces to simulate the strike on a matching number. Once the length is fully reducing , if it is a computer or player the winner is declared.
